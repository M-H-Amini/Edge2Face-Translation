# Edge2Face-Translation
Implementation of cGAN for transforming edges to faces...

In this project I'm gonna implement a cGAN to translate edges into faces!

The codes are based on Pix2Pix implementation of **Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks** paper with minor changes. 

The dataset is prepared with a modification to the *celeba* dataset to make it like sketch. I've acutally, extracted the edges there.

After that, Pix2Pix is trained on the real/sketch pairs.
